You will need to complete multiple activities (with multiple due dates) for this assignment.  Follow the provided instructions carefully.

Grade: 5 Points | Due: Friday, 9/24/21 (11:59p.m.)

    Research the Internet and share an "article" (e.g., article, tutorial, video of your choice) that is relevant to this week's course topic
        In several paragraphs, highlights what you have learned.  Include its link (URL) so that others can check it out
    Implement the following four Java methods so that you can compare and contrast iterative vs. recursive algorithms -

// Display a portion of an array backward for those elements between the last and first.  

// a is an integer array; first is the element you will need to end with since you are "walking" backward, and last is the element that you need to begin at. 

// This should be a non recursive routine.

        void displayBackward(int[] a, int first, int last);
        void displayBackwardRecursively(int[], int, int);  // Implement your logic using recursion instead; same requirements as the displayBackward method
        Create two additional methods of your choice, iterative vs. recursive, such that you could manipulate a string (instead of an array, for example) 
    Include a driver to test these four methods
