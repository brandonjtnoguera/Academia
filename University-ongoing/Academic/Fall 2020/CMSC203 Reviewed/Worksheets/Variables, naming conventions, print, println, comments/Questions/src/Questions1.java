        1: Which of the following is a valid Java variable name?
                a) ?myName
                b) 12Car
                c) $money
                d) int

                ANSWER: c

        2: Declare a variable of type int to hold the student grade

                ANSWER: int studentGrade;

        3: Declare a variable to hold the constant value for interest rate of 2.5

                ANSWER: final double INTEREST_RATE = 2.5;

        4: Declare a String variable to hold the name John

                ANSWER: String name = "John";

         5: What is the value of z after the following code is executed?

            int x = 9, y =4;
            double z = x/y;

            Answer: 2.0 because we're doing integer division and storing that in a double

         6: What is th value of z after the following code is executed?

            int x = 9;
            double y = 4, z = x/y;

            Answer: z = 2.25 because we're doing floating point division, and z is a double

         7: What is the value of z after the following code is executed?

            int x = 9;
            double y = 4, z = x%y;

            Answer: 0 because the remainder after the floatign point division is done is 0 since 9\4 is 2.25

         8: Will the following code compile?

            final int X = 10;
            X = 9;

            Answer: No, because the final int "X" has already been initialized to a value of 10, so it can't be re-assigned to a different value because it's final

         9: Declare two variables of type int and print their sum using the sum variable

            int x=4;
            int y=7;

            int sum=x+y;

            System.out.println(sum);

         10: In every Java program:

             a) There must be at least two variables declared
             b) There must be a method called main
             c) All of the variable must be integers

             Answer: b

         11: Create a Java program that:

            -	Create an integer variable to hold the approximate number of words you can type in a minute.
            -	Create a String variable to hold your name.
            -	Display a message on the Eclipse Console showing your name and the number of words you can type in a minute. Example: “Magi can type 50 words in a minute!”
            -	Use arithmetic operators to calculate the number of words you can type in a day and display the result on the console.  Example: “Magi can type 72000 words in a day!”
            -	Add at least 2 useful comments to your code.

            public static void main(String [] args){
                int wpm;    // Holds the number of words per minute the user can type
                String name;    // Holds the name of the user

                System.out.println(name + " can type " + wpm + " in a minute!");

                System.out.println(name + " can type " + wpm*60*24 + " words in a day!");
            }

         */
    }
}
