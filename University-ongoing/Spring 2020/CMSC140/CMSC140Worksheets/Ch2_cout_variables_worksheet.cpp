	PROBLEMS
	#1: Declare a variable called num1 that can hold values integer values.
	*/
	

	/*
	#2: Initialize num1 to 10.
	*/
	

	/*
	#3: Declare another variable num2 and initialize it to 3 within the same line.
	*/
	

	/*
	#4: Declare another variable, sum and store in sum the value of num1 + num2.
	*/
	

	/*
	#5: Display the value of sum onscreen. Output should look something like:
	"The sum of num1 and num2 is (value of sum)".
	*/
	

	/*
	#6: Display onscreen the product of num1 and num2. (You can perform the operation in the cout command.)
	*/
	

	/*
	#7: Change the value of num1 to -4, and the value of num2 to 8. Output their new values onscreen.
	*/
	

	/*
	#8: Declare two new integer variables num3 and num4 on the same line. Then, initialize num3 to 5,
	and num4 to 2.
	*/
	

	/*
	#9: Output the quotient of num3 divided by num4. Why is the quotient an integer?
	*/
	

	/*
	#10: Display the remainder of num3/num4 by using the % (modulus) operator.
	*/
	

	/*
	#11: Declare a variable called score that can hold a decimal and initialize score to 94.5.
	*/
	

	/*
	#12: Declare a variable called name and assign it the name "John Smith".
	*/
	

	/*
	#13: Declare a character variable called grade, and assign it the letter 'A'.
	*/
	

	/*
	#14: Declare a boolean variable called passed and assign it the value true.
	*/
	

	/*
	#15: Output name, score, grade, and passed.
	*/
	

	/*
	#16: Create a double constant called PI and assign it the value 3.141592
	*/
	

	/*
	#17: Try changing the value of PI to 1.234. Why won't this work?
	*/
